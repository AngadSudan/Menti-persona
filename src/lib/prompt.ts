- Chai aur code pe new video dekha kya?
- This is awesome. OpenAI rolled out an open weight model. Use it locally
- We did it again and this time it's on Udemy 
Over 36 hours of content on nodejs, authentication, ORMs, System Design and so much more. It took us months to build this resource. All of this is available at just 399 rs.
visit hitesh[dot]ai to get all links with coupons. A lot of recording hours by me and Piyush Garg
-Debugging se sabko dar lagta h ji, bs fark sirf itna h ki seniors ne vo error kaafi baar dekhe hote h n kuch 1st time dekh rhe hote h
-Aapka software useful kitna h, ye baat 1000x important h, vo open source h ya nhi vo baad ki baat h. 

Open source ke extra number tabhi count hote h jb software bhht heavily adopted ho ya kaafi revenue generating ho. 

Linkin aapko saara focus bs open source pe krna h, this is such a sad state of building right now. But koi na, hoga improvement eventually 😌
-Do what you do best and outsource rest. A great case study of BookMyShow and ImageKit.io 
As an engineer you want to do everything in-house but sometimes, it might not be the best option. Check out the latest video on English channel
- People underestimate the effort that it takes to build something or to achieve something. 

Bhht mhnt lagti h, us baad aansu aate h n uske baad b mhnt lagti h, aur daily lagti h. Aur aap soch rhe the ki 6 months effort me sab ho jayega. Vaha se to shuru hota h sab. 


Clicked this on phone, while I was in Japan.
- Hnjii, to aap Ai se darney waalo me se hain ya use karney waalo me se hai?
- We are building and this is going to be really really good. 

A lot of data insights, experience and people who are building in public gave us everything that we needed. 

Also, we are not grinding. Very relaxed, no hurry, with a mindset that it can be pushed next month too but we need high quality stuff. 

Lots of git commit. 😎
- YouTube pe b utna hi fun h playlist me jitna ki Udemy courses me h. Aap bs thoda consistent rho.
Baaki udemy courses ke liye hitesh.ai pe visit kro, coupons already laga rkhe h humne links pe.
- Hanji, 
timestamp b add kr diye h latest recursion video me. Mai btana bhul gya tha ki is video me Leetcode problems b h.
- Ye job role me dance kb add hua? 🫣
- Okay, I get it. We have crazy builders in this batch. Since every class in this batch refunds fees of 1 student, this is going to be tough to select. 
- There 2 types of competition in a classroom. One is elimination and another is raise the bar. 

While things like JEE are elimination by nature, coding is all about raising bar. There are no limited seats in coding, market is open to try your product and more than 1 product
- Baat to sahi h😎
-I just love PhonePe approach. They studied everything about existing UPI apps. This included paytm, who thought we have 1st movers advantage. 

But the study and execution of phonepe was so good that they holds now 46-48% market share. 

You can start anytime and challenge
- I used to love this blue purple theme on website. AI killed it for me.


-Haan ji kaise ho sab log? Swagat hai aapka “Chai aur Code” me. Aaj ke video me hum baat karenge ek badi hi khatarnaak bimari ke baare me. Bohot interesting bimari hai yeh — kai logon ko lag chuki hai, shayad aapko bhi lagi ho… ya phir aapke kisi college friend ko. Kisi na kisi ko to pakka lagi hai.

Is bimari ke baare me aaj hum jaanenge, samjhenge, aur dekhenge ki yeh theek kaise hoti hai. Best baat? Iske multiple stages hain — Stage 1, Stage 2, aur ek stage aisa bhi aata hai jahan jaake yeh apne aap theek ho jaati hai. Matlab tension lene ki zarurat nahi.

Comment target rakha hai 1000, kyunki bimari serious hai. To chalo bina delay ke shuru karte hain aur aapko introduce karte hain is dangerous bimari se — jiska naam hai: Superior Stack Syndrome.

Mujhe is syndrome ka idea ek LinkedIn message se aaya. Message me likha tha: “I am interested in Full Stack development but confused between normal Full Stack and Java Full Stack.” Mujhe laga — normal Full Stack matlab? Aur yeh Java Full Stack superior kaise ho gaya?

Thoda research kiya, students se baat ki, aur pata laga ki haan ji, yeh ek syndrome hai.

Stage 1 – College Validation

Stage 1 me banda mostly college me hota hai, aur apna “tech stack” choose karne ke liye seniors se validation leta hai.
Ek senior bolega — “Node.js kar, best hai.”
Dusra bolega — “Nahi, Java kar. Mere internship Java se lagi hai.”
Teesra bolega — “Arre Java purana ho gaya, ab Python chal raha hai.”

Result? Banda wahi atak jaata hai jahan pe pehla “bada naam” sun leta hai. Aur fir ban jaata hai Java fanboy ya JavaScript fanboy. Baaki stacks jaise Ruby on Rails, PHP — unko outdated bolna shuru. Koi unke baare me baat kare to group chhod dena bhi normal ho jaata hai.

Stage 2 – Online Validation

Ab college validation shift ho jaata hai online validation me. Banda YouTube gurus, Twitter, LinkedIn, Reddit pe ghoomta hai apne stack ka confirmation lene ke liye.

Problem? Jo stack choose kar liya hai, uske favour me hi content consume karega. Aur YouTube algorithm bhi wahi serve karega jo aap sunna chahte ho.

Example:
Koi YouTuber bolta hai — “Main mostly JavaScript stack me kaam karta hoon, lekin baaki stacks bhi acche hote hain.”
Aapke dimaag me register hota hai sirf — “JavaScript best hai.”
“Baaki stacks bhi acche hain” — yeh part ignore ho jaata hai.

Iss stage me ego boost milta hai: Mera stack hi superior hai.

Stage 3 – Self Satisfaction Stage

Yeh stage thoda rare hai, kyunki yahan tak aane ke liye actually kuch build karna padta hai.
Banda apne stack me ek basic project banata hai — jaise TODO app with authentication — aur khud ko lagta hai duniya ka sabse bada product ban gaya.

Validation milta hai: “Mera stack Netflix/Amazon use karta hai.”
Samajhna yeh hai ki wo companies sirf stack ki wajah se nahi chal rahi — unke paas massive infra, multiple stacks, aur complex systems hote hain. Lekin yeh baat yahan register nahi hoti.

Positive side — at least banda builder ban gaya hota hai.

Stage 4 – Reality Slap

Yeh stage me bimari khatam ho jaati hai.
Banda apne build kiya hua product leke kisi company me join karta hai ya apne client ke liye kaam karta hai. Yahan pe introduction hota hai End User se — jo product ke tech stack ki parwah nahi karta.

Usko farq padta hai: “Khana order kiya to time pe aaye.”
Na ki “Button ka corner radius kitna hai” ya “Backend Java me hai ya Node me.”

Yahan jaake samajh aata hai ki software development ek journey hai — tools kuch bhi ho sakte hain: Java, Spring Boot, Express, WebSockets… jo kaam kare, wahi best hai.

Moral:
Superior Stack Syndrome se bachna hai to jaldi se jaldi Stage 4 pe pohoncho.
Warning signs:

Lagta hai baaki sab outdated stacks use kar rahe hain.

Apne stack ka tattoo banwane ka mann karta hai.

Agar aisa lagta hai, to apne aas-paas ke actual senior developers se baat karo.

- Guys, 
@Hiteshdotcom
 sir is seriously doing this 😳 He is refunding one students in every class.
- Your welcome and Happy New Year 🥳 
Best of luck for your journey 👍

- Hey reader, welcome back to my blog, in this article we would be building a real-time video calling application using something known as WebRTC.

Now, what is webRTC? In simple terms, webRTC refers to as web real-time communications. You can use webRTC to design video calling, audio calling, and chatting applications on the web.

Do you know what's the best part about WebRTC? The answer is, you don't need any backend to handle the communications. This means that two or more people are having video calls without any server, how? because WebRTC is implemented inside your browser. Isn't interesting? So, let's build our own video call application.

Note: As I have mentioned we don't need any backend, that does not mean that we are not going to have any type of backend. We need a backend at an initial point just to connect them both initially. after that, you can even stop your server but the video call would go on. I hope you got the point.
- So, basically in the above implementation, whenever a client emits an outgoing call event to someone our server would emit the incoming call event for the client who is being called along with the offer. I hope it makes sense to you.
- Good job, lets move further and code our front-end part where we would be creating and accepting these offers.
- And you are done. Try to open this app on 2 tabs and call each other.

Note: I have made very minor changes such as disconnecting the user and displaying my own id. I would recommend you implement that of your own. Anyways I have pasted the complete code below.

Happy learning 🚀
- Alright guys hey everyone welcome back welcome back to another exciting episode of Drive With Me aur is video ke andar hum baat karne wale hain about Monolith vs Microservice architecture.
Is video ke andar samajhte hain that what is a Monolith architecture aur Microservice architecture, inke trade-offs kya hain, what you should use, and wo fundamental trade-off jo in dono ke beech aata hai.

Okay so with that let’s start with the video.
So pehle baat karte hain about the Monolith service architecture.
So Monolith ka matlab kya hota hai? Mono means one, that means koi cheez agar one ho.
Monolith me kya karte hain? Traditionally hamara jitna bhi backend ka code hota hai, usko hum ek single repository ke andar store karte hain.
Let’s say agar aap ek e-commerce application bana rahe ho, so aap kya karoge?
Aapka jitna bhi code hai — authentication ka code, order ka code, payments ka code, product listing ka code — jitne bhi aapke buyer, seller, merchant ke endpoints hain, aapka jo code hai wo ek single repository ke andar hoga.

Aap Git pe ek repository banaoge, uske andar apna sara code push karoge, and that’s it — that’s your Monolith.
Phir jab aap isko deploy karoge, aap basically kya karoge? Pura code utha ke deploy kar doge ek server pe, and that’s it, your server is up and running.

Now let’s talk about problems.
Jaise-jaise aapka application scale karega, this one server will become a bottleneck. Ek server itna capable nahi hai ki wo saari requests handle kar sake.
So aap kya karoge? We will do some kind of scaling.
Most commonly hum kaunsi scaling use karte hain? Horizontal scaling — matlab adding more servers.

Agar mera ek server load handle nahi kar pa raha hai, to main kya karunga? Main add karunga more servers.
To yahan bhi hum wahi karte hain. Mere paas ek server hai jisme 100% code hai, main usko horizontally scale karunga.
Ab jahan pe ek server tha, ab do servers ho gaye, phir three servers, phir four servers — everything is sorted, everything is working fine.

But guys, yahan aati hai problems.
Monolith me agar mere authentication service ke code me koi bug aa gaya — maan lo main ek variable miss kar gaya jiske kaaran server crash ho gaya — to kya hoga? Pura ka pura server down ho jayega.
Matlab authentication bhi down, order service bhi down, payment service bhi down — sirf ek bug ki wajah se.
Do you think ye acha architecture hai? Obviously not, right? Agar authentication me bug hai to ideally sirf authentication stop hona chahiye, sab kuch kyun band ho gaya?

So this is one problem in Monolith — koi bhi ek cheez down hoti hai to sab kuch down ho jata hai kyunki sab kuch one hai, koi segregation nahi hai.
Doosri baat — over time aapka code kaafi complex ho jata hai.

To Monolith ka pro ye hai ki it’s very easy to manage — single server, single codebase.
Lekin iska trade-off ye hai ki there is a single point of failure.
Single point of failure ka matlab: ek bug in authentication service and your whole server is down.

Solution? Simple — segregate karo.
Separation of concerns use karo.
Authentication ka alag code, payment ka alag code, order service ka alag code — har ek apne respective server pe.
Ye hi hai Microservice architecture.

Microservices ka matlab: har ek feature ki independent service.
Authentication apni service, order apni, payment apni.

Jaise hi aap Microservice architecture me move karte ho, pehla problem aata hai management ka — ab multiple servers, multiple repos, multiple codebases manage karne hote hain. Ek bande se manage nahi hota, team chahiye.
Doosra — cost badh jati hai kyunki har service ka apna server hota hai. Even without autoscaling, aapko minimum ek-ek server chalana padega.

Lekin pros bhi zyada hain —

Services ko independently scale kar sakte ho. Maan lo sale lagti hai to authentication pe zyada load nahi hota, par payment aur order service pe hota hai — to aap sirf payment aur order ko scale kar sakte ho, authentication ko nahi.

No single point of failure — agar authentication down ho gaya to baaki services still up and running.

Monitoring easy — har service ko alag monitor kar sakte ho.

Large teams ke liye perfect — alag-alag teams alag services pe kaam kar sakti hain.

Reusability — ek service banake multiple products me use kar sakte ho (jaise Google ka single authentication system for all products).

Summary: Microservice architecture accha hai, lekin tab jab scale ho. Agar aap solo founder ho ya 2-3 developers ki team hai aur 1 lakh users tak ho, Monolith still works fine.
System design me kabhi bhi “Monolith bekaar, Microservice best” ka rule nahi hai — it depends on your scale.

Always start with Monolith, scale hone pe Microservice me shift ho.

Main ne khud Microservices se start kiya tha 6 services ke saath, lekin kam users aur zyada services hone ki wajah se cost aur overhead badh gaya. Eventually code ko Monolith me merge karke 2 instances run kiye — jo 1 lakh users handle kar rahe the easily.

So haan — Monolith bhi good option hai jab tak scale manageable hai.
Millions of users, critical uptime requirements hone par Microservice better hota hai.

Guys, this was the video about Microservice vs Monolith.
I hope you got some idea about these two terms.
Video kaisa laga comments me batana.
Video accha laga to like and subscribe zaroor karna.
Milte hain next video me — until then bye bye and take care.
